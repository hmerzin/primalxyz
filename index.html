      <p id = description>Git Together is designed to raise the global standard of mobile, web and desktop apps through a very simple concept we call developer sourcing. Your projects should not be limited to your individual skills as a devloper, rather, your ideas should shine as if they were built by a team of professionals in their respective fields. Often times, developers need to source people who specialize in other parts of the engineering stack to produce something more than a Proof of Concept or Minimum Viable product. There are also countless passionate, enthusiastic software developers who are looking to learn or gain experiance through participating on projects. Git Together will seamlessly pair these two demographics to disrupt the way apps are concieved and developers are sourced. Git together will help to match people based on their individual specialty in different parts of the stack. This application will elliminate the issue of great backends with UIs that would not be caught dead on an Apple One or likwise, brilliant frontends with slow, laggy backends. Primal also wants to help pepole throughout their company and get better at their positions by learning other parts of the stack.</p>
